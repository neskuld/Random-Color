### [Random Color Generator](https://random-color-neon.vercel.app/)



I came across this sweet function while browsing the internet:

>
>``#${Math.random().toString(16).slice(2, 8).padEnd(6, '0')}``
>

It made me think to myself: "I really want to click this a couple of times to see the colors it would generate..."

And then this tiny but really cool project was born.
